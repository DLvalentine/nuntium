--- GENERAL/EVENTUALLY ---
- rein in the scope of this, update the repo docs to reflect it. Going to focus on CLI and GUI for now, and maybe come up with one more aggregator?
    - The GUI for this could be simple - just a Rails app with auto, infinite scroll down the page? With options for pause and speed increase/decrease
- I want to come up with a way to... release this with a DB of rss feeds that exist? There doesn't seem to be a way to discover RSS feeds easily
- Take a look at class structure again, make more use of inheritance where it makes sense. 
- use super for inherited methods, duh
- might make sense to add a JSON reader function to util.rb, and then make specific uses of it in the aggregator classes
- come up with config template for 1.0
- add keyboard shortcuts to README
- create gem for this, for "installer"
- Basic RSSHub integration is done, need to support Mac/linux, update docs, and write install script for this whole package - to include... Ruby, Node.. everything.
- ^ similarly, should probably get some mac-compatible dev scripts
- Move all the OS specific junk into their own directories

--- BUGFIX / CRITICAL ---
- Improve throttling issue with stocks, apply to rss feeds
- come up with CLI options => override config stuff
- be able to handle more than 10 stock symbols, eventually - right now we just offload it, wait for the rate limiter, then call again
- Add more details to README, to include the ahk stuff I added as a bonus to our Windows users out there <3
- Update the RSS aggregator to refresh every 2 hours, tune this. Or, make it configurable
