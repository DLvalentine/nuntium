# Windows Addons/Prerequisites

This directory is divided into addons and prerequisites subdirectories. The addons directory currently contains AutoHotkey scripts that I think allow for the optimal experience on Windows Command Prompt.

The prerequisites directory contains applications that are required to install on Windows in order to use 100% of the functionality of Nuntium. It currently contains the C++ Build Tools that allow you to use RSSHub with Nuntium on Windows.
